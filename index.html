							Why
						</h4>
						<p>
							My interest piqued up when my friends started to create their own websites to get themselves
							and identity online. To me, this looked like a great chance to challenge myself and learn
							something new.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h4 class="section-heading">
							Design process
						</h4>
						<p>
							The big question that I wanted to answer when I was building my website was what is the
							best way to express myself? Personally, it's through my projects where I can show what I value
							through the decisions I make. So, I was naturally inclined to make a project portfolio.

							Despite tempted to just link every project I did to my GitHub, I don't believe that source code
							is the right medium to document decision making. I'm not perfect, and my ideas definitely aren't either.
						</p>

						<img class="article-figure" src="second_attempt3.PNG">

						<p>
							Keeping track of my thoughts and drafts provides a basis where other people and I can learn
							what works and what doesn't. I value the learning process that comes from each mistake.

							The most trouble I had with this website was the layout. In the end I decided to follow the
							footsteps of facebook and youtube.
						</p>

						<img class="article-figure" src="youtube.PNG">

						<p>
							From my own standpoint, their layout gave me the ability to focus on the main content while
							simultaneously providing me a menu of all my accomplishments. As a result, you could focus
							on both items (main content and projects) without needed to refresh or change the entire screen.
							It feels quicker and more intuitive that way.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h4 class="section-heading">
							Trade-Offs
						</h4>
						<p>
							There were a couple of trade-offs I had to make when I kept to this layout. The main problem
							is accommodating for different screen sizes. The phone is a vertical view port,
							while the laptop (or desktop) is a horizontal viewport. Simply, separating the screen
							horizontally will not work with a phone as the sections become too thin. I had to make
							a compromise resulting in making the user focus on one thing at a time for smaller screen sizes.

							Prelude
						</h4>
						<p>
							This was a school group project that was designed to used GIS (graphical information system) data
							to mark locations and find the fastest path between them. It comes with a graphical user
							interface and a search bar; in essence it's just like google maps.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="row">
						<h4 class="section-heading">
							Design Goals
						</h4>
						<p>
							The full application was focused on being intuitive and functional. We defined intuitiveness
							to be its ability to work like most online mapping web applications like Google maps, Bing maps,
							and Apple maps. Second, functionality was defined by the
							<a href="http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~vaughn/ece297/" target="_blank">constraints</a>
							set by the course.

						<h4 class="section-heading">
							Interface
						</h4>
						<p>
							Although the interface wasn't much of a problem, the difficulty was choosing the right colour
							palette for the map. What I noticed about the similarities between most online maps are a couple
							of things. First is that the main routes are always coloured in some mix of red - google maps
							and apple maps have the highways coloured orange, while bing maps it's purple. The purpose of this
							is to get the user's attention on what the important parts of the map should be.

							Algorithms
						</h4>
						<p>
							In section M4, the Travelling Courier Solver required to use the Shortest Path Finder to try
							to find the fastest path between two landmarks or intersections. Despite it being possible to
							find the shortest path between two intersections, the
							<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem" target="_blank">TSP</a>
							(traveling salesman problem) that this program is designed to solve unfortunately harbours no
							absolute answer. There is only better.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our approach to this problem was to use a genetic algorithm. In a nutshell like natural
							selection, it begins with an initial population and with each passing generation the children
							will become better adapted to the underlying pressures defined by the system. In this case
							the pressure is the the set with the longest overall path will be eliminated.
							Therefore algorithm speed, the ability to run through as many iterations (or generations)
							as possible is paramount. In order to optimize the final solution, I implemented multi-threading.
							Specifically this would allow our program to compute the fastest path between multiple intersections
							simultaneously. The result was a 14 percent increase in speed.

						</h4>

							This one was a personal favorite of mine. Ever since I was a kid I have always been a big
							fan of Pokemon. So given complete creative freedom for this project, I had to naturally
							lean to my childhood.

							Design Goals
						</h4>
						<p>
							There were no specific requirements for this project, so the only thing I was working towards
							was to make my game as authentic as possible.

						<h4 class="section-heading">
							Architecture
						</h4>
						<p>
							This entire thing was done in Verilog, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language" target="_blank">
							hardware description language </a> (HDL). Unlike most programming languages, with Verilog I
							had to create custom hardware using a FPGA to control every single pixel on the screen. So
							how did I do it? The two main components that were needed was the control path and the
							data path. The control path is designed to send signals to the data path to tell it to run
							certain animations or drawings based on the input of the user. Control path == brain and
							the data path == the arms and legs.
